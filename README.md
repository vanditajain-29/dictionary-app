# Dictionary App

A simple and interactive dictionary application built with React, allowing users to search for word definitions, view a word of the day, and keep track of their search history.

**Features**

_Word Search:_ Instantly get definitions for any English word.

_Word of the Day (WOTD):_ Discover a new word and its definition daily.

_Search History:_ Easily revisit previously searched words with a clickable history list.

_Responsive Design:_ Optimized for various screen sizes.

_Loading Indicator:_ Provides feedback while fetching definitions.

_Error Handling:_ Displays user-friendly messages for invalid words or API issues.


**Technologies Used**

_React:_ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

_HTML:_ For structuring the web content.

_CSS:_ For styling and layout (inline styles and basic App.css as provided in the original code, though a full Tailwind implementation would be more robust).

_Dictionary API:_ https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/ for _word definitions_.

_Random Word API:_ https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/ for the _Word of the Day feature_.
